1. About Vulnserver

Vulnserver is a multithreaded Windows based TCP server that listens for client connections on port 9999 (by default) and 
allows the user to run a number of different commands that are vulnerable to various types of exploitable buffer overflows.
This software is intended mainly as a tool for learning how to find and exploit buffer overflow bugs, and each of the bugs 
it contains is subtly different from the others, requiring a slightly different approach to be taken when writing the exploit.


2. Running the software

To run the software, simply execute vulnserver.exe. The provided essfunc.dll library must be in a location where it can be found by vulnserver.exe - keeping both files in the same directory will usually work fine.
To start the server listening on the default port of 9999, simply run the executable, to use an alternate port, provide the port number as a command line parameter.
Once the software is running, simply connect to it on port 9999 using a command line client like netcat. Issue a HELP command (case sensitive) to see what functions are supported and go from there....
